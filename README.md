# Tryptic

Directory viewer inspired by [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).

The UI consists of 3 floating windows. In the center is the currently focused directory. On the left is the parent directory.
The right window contains either a child directory, or a file preview.

With default bindings use `j` and `k` (or any other motions like `G`,  `gg`, `/` etc) to navigate within the current directory.
Use `h` and `l` to switch to the parent or child directories respectively.
If the buffer on the right is a file, then pressing `l` will close Tryptic and open that file in the buffer you were just in.
You only ever control or focus the middle window.

The advantage of this over other plugins like Netrw and Dirvish is that it provides context, which is missing when you can only see one directory at a time.

## Installation

Example using [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  'simonmclean/tryptic',
  dependencies = {
    'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim', -- required
    'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' -- optional
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Below is the default config. Feel free to overwrite any of these.

```lua
require 'tryptic'.setup {
  mappings = {
    open_tryptic = '<leader>-',
    -- Everything below is buffer-local, meaning it will only apply to Tryptic windows
    show_help = 'g?',
    jump_to_cwd = '.', -- Pressing again will toggle back
    nav_left = 'h',
    nav_right = { 'l', '<CR>' },
    delete = 'd',
    add = 'a',
    copy = 'c',
    rename = 'r',
    cut = 'x', -- Pressing again will remove the item from the cut list
    paste = 'p',
    quit = 'q',
    toggle_hidden = '<leader>.'
  }
}
```

Key mappings can either be a string, or a table of strings if you want multiple bindings.

## TODO
- Bug
    - When doing cut-n-paste, cursor pos can change in unintuitive way
- Code quality
    - Organise the contents of init.lua into a separate module
    - Maximise loading efficiency
- Features
    - When creating a file or dir, the cursor should move to it
    - Docs
    - Toggle hidden
    - Git signs
    - Diagnostics
    - Cut, copy and delete should work with visual selection
- tests
